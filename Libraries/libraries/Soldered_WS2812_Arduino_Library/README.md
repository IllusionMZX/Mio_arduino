These small LEDs are not just ordinary lights - each is specific because it has a built-in small integrated circuit (IC) that is able to turn on the LED light in 16 million different colors. IC is WS2812 and it uses a single wire can control thousands of these LEDs. With a little imagination by putting these pixels, you get superior effects with a minimum effort. These lamps are easy to control with Croduino.

- Color: RGB (red/green/blue)
- Voltage: 5V
- Power: max. 60mA/pixel
- Diode type: WS2812Â SMD LED (5050 LED diode with built IC)
- Dimensions: diameter of 10 mm

WS2812B is an extremely interesting LED that can emit light in red, green or blue - or any combination of these three colors, able to show a total of approximately 16 million different colors. On this board, diodes are arranged in a circle. They are controlled by a single pin with only a few lines of code from Arduino IDE. That's possible thanks to the integrated controller inside the LED itself!

- Number of LEDs: 7
- Circle diameter: 23mm
- Voltage: 5V
- LED type: WS2812B
- Current: 18mA per LED
